# Digit-Classifier
Wrote a neural network that uses fundamental DL algorithms to identify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset. 

Much of the code I've written is inspired from Chapter 1 of the book I used to study Deep Learning: Michael Nielson's <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html" target="_blank"> Neural Networks and Deep Learning </a>.

I borrowed the dataset of handwritten images from MNIST website:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The classifier works as a Jupyter notebook in <a href="https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/Digit-Classifier/blob/master/classifier.ipynb">classifier.ipynb</a> file.

You can find the official code in the official repository of the book, <a href="https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning" target="_blank"> here. </a>
